          Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience in infrastructure, DevOps, and fullstack development. 
          Completing my Master's in Data Science, combined theoretical machine learning knowledge with 
          practical experience in AI. I'm passionate about working with ML infrastructure solutions
          and building scalable AI systems.

          At Juniper Networks, I worked with a team to integrate Generative AI capabilities into traditional infrastructure, 
          leveraging open-source technologies, LLMs, and vector databases. Through this experience, I developed a deep
          interest in creating tools that enhance developer productivity and deploying AI systems at scale.
